## 2. Project Overview

This repository contains the work for **PROJECT HCMST**, a group project for UBC'S MDS - DSCI 522.  
The `README.md` includes information for:

- **How Couples Meet Stay Together (HCMST)**
- **Summary**
- **How-to run analysis**
- **Dependencies**
- **Licenses** (MIT License)

These sections should be updated and kept in sync with any changes you make to the project.

## 3. How to Set Up Your Environment

We use **conda** for environment management, with both an `environment.yml` and a generated `conda-lock.yml`.

### 3.1. Using `environment.yml` (recommended)

To create a development environment from the repository root:

`conda env create -f environment.yml -n relationship-quality-prediction` <br>
`conda activate relationship-quality-prediction`

The base environment includes versions of:<br>
Python 3.12.12<br>
numpy 2.3.5<br>
pandas 2.3.3<br>
matplotlib 3.10.8<br>
seaborn 0.13.2<br>
altair 6.0.0<br>
scikit-learn 1.7.2<br>
conda 25.7.0 <br>
environment<br>

### 3.2. Using `conda-lock.yml` (for fully reproducible installs)
`conda-lock.yml` is an auto-generated lock file that pins exact package versions (including checksums) for multiple platforms. Do not edit it by hand. <br>

To install the exact locked environment:

`conda-lock install -n relationship-quality-prediction conda-lock.yml`
`conda activate relationship-quality-prediction`

Key notes:
-  The lock file is generated from `environment.yml`.
-  To update a single package (e.g., altair) while respecting existing constraints:
  
`conda-lock lock --lockfile conda-lock.yml --update altair`

To fully re-solve the environment after changing environment.yml:

`conda-lock -f environment.yml --lockfile conda-lock.yml`

If you change dependencies, you must:

1.  Update `environment.yml`.
2.  Regenerate `conda-lock.yml` using conda-lock as shown above.
3.  Commit both files.

## 4. Workflow: How to Contribute Changes
### 4.1. Typical contribution flow
#### 4.1.1. Create a branch

`git checkout -b feature/short-description`

Examples:<br>
`feature/add-eda-notebook`<br>
`bugfix/fix-altair-plot`<br>
`docs/update-readme`<br>

####  4.1.2. Make your changes
-  Follow the environment setup above.
-  Keep notebooks, scripts, and docs organized.
-  Prefer small, focused commits with clear messages.

#### 4.1.3. Run checks (if available)
-  Run any tests or analysis scripts the team agrees on (e.g., pytest, make test, or a specific python/bash script).
-  Ensure your code runs end-to-end in the project environment.

#### 4.1.4. Update documentation
-  Update `README.md` when:
    -  The way to run the analysis changes.
    -  Dependencies change.
    -  The project title or summary becomes more concrete.
-  Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you change the contribution process.
-  If relevant, add comments/markdown cells to notebooks explaining your changes.

#### 4.1.5.  Open a pull request (PR)
-  Summarize the motivation and high-level changes.
-  Link to any related issues/tasks.
-  Mention any breaking changes or new dependencies.
-  Ask for at least one review from a teammate.

#### 4.1.6.  Address review feedback
-  Respond to comments respectfully.
-  Push follow-up commits rather than force-pushing (unless the team agrees otherwise).
-  Ensure final CI/tests pass (if configured).

## 5. Working with Notebooks and Data
-  Keep notebooks clean:
    -  Restart kernel and run all cells before committing.
    -  Avoid committing large, unused intermediate outputs.
-  Data handling:
    -  Do not commit large or sensitive data files directly unless explicitly allowed.
    -  Prefer scripts/notebooks that download or generate data from documented sources.

If you add or change data sources, update the `README.md` and any relevant documentation so that others can reproduce your analysis. 

---

## 6. Coding & Style Guidelines
   
These are suggested defaults; align within the group and adjust as needed:
-  Python
    -  Follow PEP 8 style where feasible.
    -  Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
    -  Prefer functions and small modules over monolithic scripts.
-  R / notebooks 
    -  Keep code chunks focused and documented.
    -  Use meaningful object names and comments for non-obvious logic.
-  Visualization
    -  Use informative axis labels, legends, and titles.
    -  Make plots reproducible (no manual click-driven steps).
-  Reproducibility
    -  Avoid hard-coding local file paths.
    -  Use relative paths within the repo (e.g., data/, results/, figures/).

## 7. Updating Dependencies
   
When you need a new Python package or version bump:

-  Add/update it in environment.yml under dependencies. <br>
-  Re-lock the environment:

`conda-lock -f environment.yml --lockfile conda-lock.yml`

-  Confirm the project still runs in a fresh environment.<br>
-  Commit both environment.yml and conda-lock.yml and mention the dependency change in your PR.

---

## 8. Reporting Issues & Requesting Help

If you encounter a problem (bug, unclear documentation, environment issues, etc.):
-  Check existing issues/PRs (if using GitHub Issues).
-  When opening a new issue, please include:
    -  A short, descriptive title.
    -  Steps to reproduce (commands, environment info).
    -  Expected vs. actual behavior.
    -  Error messages or screenshots where helpful.

Within the team, you’re encouraged to:
-  Ask questions early to avoid getting blocked.
-  Answer others’ questions kindly and constructively.
-  Reference relevant parts of the Code of Conduct in case of conflict.
