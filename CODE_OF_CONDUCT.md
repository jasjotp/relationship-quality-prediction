# Code of Conduct

## Community Standards

Our project aims to create a productive, welcoming environment so team members with different backgrounds, skills, and perspectives can collaborate.

### Be respectful

We assume good intentions, avoid personal attacks, and resolve conflict with empathy and professionalism.

### Be collaborative

The project depends on contributions from multiple people. We work transparently and include relevant teammates early in discussions and decisions.

### Ask for help

Asking questions early prevents misunderstandings and responding to questions in a supportive manner is expected.

### Step down considerately

If a team member needs to leave the project or reduce involvement, they should communicate this in advance and help transition their responsibilities.

### Delegation and decision making

Teams should delegate tasks based on ability and interest. Decisions should be informed by discussion, evidence, and input from those affected.

### Trust and communication

We trust the people closest to a problem to make informed decisions. If disagreements arise team members should discuss the issue respectfully to seek common ground.

### Diversity and inclusivity

Discrimination, exclusion, or harassment of any kind is not acceptable.

### Unacceptable behaviour

* Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behaviour
* Personal attacks, insults, or hostile communication
* Dismissing or belittling contributions or questions

### Consequences of unacceptable behaviour

* A private warning from the group
* Removal from specific tasks or responsibilities
* Formal reporting to the instructor or TA
