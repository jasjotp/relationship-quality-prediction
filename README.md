## Project Summary 📄

This project analyzes data from the **How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST)** survey to explore how demographic and relationship characteristics relate to self-reported **relationship quality**. We focus on a subset of variables including respondent age, income category, marital status, relationship duration, and number of children.

We begin with **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, examining the distribution of relationship quality, visualizing the income distribution, and computing a correlation matrix for key predictors and the outcome. We then build a **multi-class logistic regression model** to predict relationship quality from these features. The workflow includes explicit data cleaning (handling missing values, type conversion), appropriate encoding of ordinal income categories, and scaling of numeric predictors via a scikit-learn preprocessing pipeline.

Model performance is evaluated using **confusion matrices** on both training and test data, as well as a **micro-averaged one-vs-rest ROC curve** to assess overall discriminative ability across classes. Together, the analysis and models provide an interpretable baseline for understanding which characteristics are most associated with higher or lower reported relationship quality, and they establish a reproducible workflow that can be extended with more complex models in later milestones.

##  1.How to Run the Analysis 

### 1.1. Clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:jasjotp/dsci522_group29_milestone_1.git` <br>
`cd dsci522_group29_milestone_1`

---

##  2. Create the conda environment

`conda env create -f environment.yml -n dsci522_milestone1` <br>
`conda activate dsci522_milestone1`

---

## 3. Use the Lockfile

For reproducible installs:

`conda-lock install -n dsci522_milestone1 conda-lock.yml` <br>
`conda activate dsci522_milestone1`

---

## 4. Launch the Analysis Notebook

Run<br>

`jupyter lab`<br>

Open the `analysis.ipynb` file to run the exploratory analysis and code.

---

## 5. Dependencies
